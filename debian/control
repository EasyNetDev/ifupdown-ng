Description: Network Interface Management tool similar to ifupdown{,2}
 ifupdown-ng is a network device manager that is largely compatible with
 Debian ifupdown, BusyBox ifupdown and Cumulus Networks' ifupdown2.
 .
 It is intended as a drop-in replacement for all aforementioned suites and
 provides the well-known ifup/ifdown/ifquery tools as well as ifctrstat to
 query interface statistics via CLI.
 .
 ifupdown-ng provides dependecy resolutions between interfaces (physical,
 bond, vlan, bridges, etc.) to configure interfaces in a meaniful order
 independent of their order within the configuration file(s).
 .
 ifupdown-ng currently has support for B.A.T.M.A.N. adv., bonding, bridges,
 MPLS, PPP, regular tunnels + wireguard, VLANs, VRFs, VXLAN, as well as
 setting hardware/driver parameters with ethtool.
